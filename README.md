# Spring Boot and Thymeleaf library for htmx

This library provides helper classes and a [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) dialect
to make it easy to work with [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
in a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application.

More information about htmx can be viewed on [their website](https://htmx.org/).

## Installation

The library is available
on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.wimdeblauwe/htmx-spring-boot-thymeleaf),
so it is easy to add the dependency to your project.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.wimdeblauwe</groupId>
    <artifactId>htmx-spring-boot-thymeleaf</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST_VERSION_HERE</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

### Configuration

The included Spring Boot autoconfiguration will enable the htmx integrations.

### Request Headers

_See [Request Headers Reference](https://htmx.org/reference/#request_headers) for the related htmx documentation._

Methods can be annotated with `@HxRequest` to be selected when an htmx-based request (ie `hx-get`) is made.

```java
@GetMapping("/users")
@HxRequest                  // Called when hx-get request to '/users/' is made 
public String htmxRequest(HtmxRequest details){
    service.doSomething(details);

    return "partial";
}

@GetMapping("/users")        // Only called on a full page refresh, not an htmx request
public String normalRequest(HtmxRequest details){
    service.doSomething(details);

    return "users";
}
```

These annotations allow for composition if you wish to combine them,
so you could combine annotations to make a custom `@HxGetMapping`.

#### Using `HtmxRequest` to inspect HTML request headers

The `HtmxRequest` object can be injected into controller methods to check the various htmx request headers.

```java
@GetMapping
@ResponseBody
public String htmxRequestDetails(HtmxRequest htmxReq) { // HtmxRequest is injected
    if(htmxReq.isHistoryRestoreRequest()){
        // ...
    }

    return "";
}
```

### Response Headers

_See [Response Headers Reference](https://htmx.org/reference/#response_headers) for the related htmx documentation._

Setting the `hx-trigger` header triggers an event when the response is swapped in by htmx.
The `@HxTrigger` annotation supports doing that for you:

```java
@GetMapping("/users")
@HxRequest
@HxTrigger("userUpdated") // 'userUpdated' event will be triggered by htmx
public String hxUpdateUser(){
    return "users";
}
```

### Processors

_See [Attribute Reference](https://htmx.org/reference/#attributes) for the related htmx documentation._

Thymeleaf processors are provided to allow Thymeleaf to be able to perform calculations and expressions
in htmx-related attributes.
Note the `:` colon instead of the typical hyphen.

- `hx:get`: This is a Thymeleaf processing enabled attribute
- `hx-get`: This is just a static attribute if you don't need the Thymeleaf processing

For example, this Thymeleaf template:

```html
<div hx:get="@{/users/}+${userId}" hx-target="#otherElement">Load user details</div>
```

Will be rendered as:

```html

<div hx-get="/users/123" hx-target="#otherElement">Load user details</div>
```

The included Thymeleaf dialect has corresponding processors for most of the `hx-*` attributes.
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/htmx-spring-boot-thymeleaf/issues) if something is missing.

> **Note**
> Be careful about using `#` in the value. If you do `hx:target="#mydiv"`, then this will not work as Thymeleaf uses
> the `#` symbol for translation keys. Either use `hx-target="#mydiv"` or `hx:target="${'#mydiv'}"`

### Map support for hx:vals

The [hx-vals](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-vals/) attribute allows to add to the parameters that will be submitted
with the AJAX request. The value of the attribute should be a JSON string.

The library makes it a bit easier to write such a JSON string by adding support for inline maps.

For example, this Thymeleaf expression:

```html

<div hx:vals="${ {id: user.id } }"></div>
```

will render as:

```html

<div hx-vals="{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: 1234 }"></div>
```

(Given `user.id` has the value `1234`)

### OOB Swap support

htmx supports updating multiple targets by returning multiple partial response with
[`hx-swap-oob`](https://htmx.org/docs/#oob_swaps). Return partials using this library use the `HtmxResponse` as a return
type:

```java
@GetMapping("/partials/main-and-partial")
public HtmxResponse getMainAndPartial(Model model){
        model.addAttribute("userCount",5);
        return new HtmxResponse()
        .addTemplate("users :: list")
        .addTemplate("users :: count");
        }
```

### Spring Security

The library has an `HxRefreshHeaderAuthenticationEntryPoint` that you can use to have htmx force a full page browser
refresh in case there is an authentication failure.
If you don't use this, then your login page might be appearing in place of a swap you want to do somewhere.
See [htmx-authentication-error-handling](https://www.wimdeblauwe.com/blog/2022/10/04/htmx-authentication-error-handling/)
blog post for detailed information.

To use it, add it to your security configuration like this:

```java
    @Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http)throws Exception{
        // probably some other configurations here
        http...

        var entryPoint=new HxRefreshHeaderAuthenticationEntryPoint();
        var requestMatcher=new RequestHeaderRequestMatcher("HX-Request");
        http.exceptionHandling(exception->
        exception.defaultAuthenticationEntryPointFor(entryPoint,
        requestMatcher));
        return http.build();
        }
```
